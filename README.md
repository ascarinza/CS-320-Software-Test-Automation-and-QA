•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  Ensuring that code, programs, and software are secure starts from the beginning by using best practices and maintaining high quality. To ensure functional and secure products, testing procedures such as unit tests, integration tests, and system tests can be used. 
Manually reviewing and refactoring code to meet the requirements is another great way to produce high-quality deliverables. 
  
•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Interpreting user needs starts by having productive interviews with clients and customers where valuable questions that help produce an outline are answered. Using other methods such as surveys and user stories is some of the most effective ways to understand and 
incorporate user needs. User requirements guide good development so having a set of well-defined requirements will help a development team better align the software to the client.
  
•	How do I approach designing software?

  Before designing software, a set of requirements needs to be identified. Without a clear goal and set of criteria to test for, it becomes hard to determine if the application is successful and matches what the client is looking for. Using best practices such as 
designing modular, scalable code helps in refactoring and testing. The more efficient the design and development process is, the quicker something can get tested and deployed.
